Water Forward 2024: Integrating Climate and Hydrology Analysis for Long-Term Resiliency

1. The Strategic Foundation of Water Forward 2024 (WF24)

Water Forward 2024 (WF24) codifies a transition from reactive municipal planning to a proactive, risk-based hydroclimatological framework. It is not merely a five-year utility update; it is a critical 100-year strategic roadmap designed to navigate the compounding pressures of aggressive urban growth and non-stationary climate volatility. By extending the planning horizon to 2120, Austin Water moves beyond traditional municipal forecasting to capture the full cycle of climate volatility—decadal shifts and multi-year extremes that a standard 20- or 50-year plan would inevitably miss. This strategic depth allows the City to transition from a vulnerable single-source reliance on the Colorado River and Highland Lakes toward a resilient water resource portfolio.

Mission and Principles The ethical and operational compass for WF24 is rooted in a mission to develop diverse, environmentally conscious strategies that ensure water security, equity, and affordability. The seven Guiding Principles serve as the decision-making framework:

* Resiliency: Engineering a system robust enough to withstand the shocks of growth, drought, and climate change.
* Diversity of Strategy: Optimizing all available sources, including reuse, conservation, and efficiency.
* Holistic & Inclusive Approach: Integrating community values into technical resource planning.
* Equity & Affordability: Utilizing the Equity and Affordability Roadmap to mitigate impacts on marginalized communities.
* Environmental Protection: Safeguarding the Colorado River and the broader natural ecosystem.
* Risk Mitigation: Actively minimizing implementation and operational risks.
* Local Focus: Prioritizing the development and retention of locally available water supplies.

This shift to a 100-year integrated water resource plan (IWRP) fundamentally alters Austin’s risk profile. By valuing long-term reliability over short-term cost-minimization, the City builds the necessary infrastructure and cultural buffers to ensure that a single hydrologic failure does not compromise municipal stability.

2. The Backdrop of Uncertainty: Planning for 2120

Effective resource strategy for the next century requires a rejection of "stationarity"—the outdated assumption that historical records are a reliable proxy for future hydrologic risk. WF24 shifts the focus from deterministic forecasting toward stochastic, scenario-based resilience. In this paradigm, we do not attempt to predict a single future; rather, we stress-test our strategies against a vast range of plausible, high-uncertainty futures to identify solutions that remain viable under extreme pressure.

Core Planning Uncertainties

Driver	Baseline Reality	Projected Extremes (2120)
Population & Demand	~1M people served; 2.4M in Greater Austin area.	Service population projected to reach 3.2M.
Drought & Climate Change	2008-2016 and 2022-2023 record low inflows.	Higher temperatures, increased evaporation, variable rainfall.
Regional Supply	Current reliance on Highland Lakes & Colorado River.	Significant uncertainty in timing/yield of LCRA regional projects.

The unprecedented low inflows observed during the 2008-2016 and 2022-2023 droughts confirmed that historical data is insufficient for modern risk management. Austin Water has consequently pivoted to planning for Droughts Worse than the Drought of Record (DWDR). This strategic shift acknowledges that climate-driven evaporation and runoff variability are creating a "new normal" where past extremes are now the baseline for future risks.

3. Conceptual Framework of the Climate and Hydrology Analysis

The Climate and Hydrology Analysis serves as the technical "stress test" for Austin’s water security. Unlike traditional plans that look for a "most likely" outcome, this analysis utilizes a stochastic modeling approach to evaluate performance across 666 modeling scenarios. By integrating Global Circulation Models (GCMs) for climate projections and Water Availability Models (WAMs) for river basin simulation, we can identify robust strategies that provide reliable yields regardless of which specific hydrologic future unfolds.

Growing Risk Over Time (No Strategy Implemented) Without intervention, the frequency and magnitude of unmet demand escalate sharply as we move toward the 2120 horizon:

* 2030: Shortages occur in approximately 5% of modeling scenarios.
* 2070: Shortage risk rises to 50% of scenarios. Crucially, 37% of scenarios show a massive unmet need between 100,000 and 300,000 AF/yr, while only 13% show a need under 100k AF/yr.
* 2120: Approximately 60% of modeling scenarios show a shortage.

This granular data on the magnitude of risk—particularly the 37% chance of a massive 100k+ AF/yr shortfall by 2070—dictated the selection of high-yield supply and storage strategies capable of closing these wide gaps.

4. Translating Analysis into Decision-Making: The Strategy Portfolio

The Climate and Hydrology Analysis transformed theoretical risk into a diversified portfolio of actionable projects, categorized into four strategic themes:

1. Demand Reduction: This involves utility-side water loss control (leak detection/smart meters), customer-side management, and Native & Efficient Landscaping. While landscaping conversion carries a high community cost of $5,112/AF, it is a vital strategy for building a "water-wise" community culture, providing an unquantifiable resiliency buffer during DWDR events.
2. Non-Potable Reuse: Expansion of the GoPurple program, Onsite Water Reuse Systems (OWRS), and centralized/decentralized reclaimed water networks to decouple growth from potable demand.
3. Storage and Supply Augmentation: This sector contains the "heavy lifters." Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) is the cornerstone, providing a yield of 44,500 AF/yr for both average and drought conditions. Indirect Potable Reuse (IPR) provides a targeted drought yield of 22,400 AF/yr and is designed with an adaptive trigger for implementation earlier in severe drought conditions.
4. Environmental Stewardship: WF24 prioritizes land conservation (including 14,000 acres in the Balcones Canyonlands and 34,000 acres of Water Quality Protection Lands). For the utility, this is a pre-treatment cost-avoidance strategy, ensuring that source water quality remains high to minimize future treatment infrastructure costs.

By balancing low-cost demand management (52/AF for customer-side management) with high-yield supply projects like ASR (2,003/AF) and IPR ($880/AF), Austin Water achieves a portfolio that is both hydrologically robust and economically defensible.

5. Implementation, Accountability, and Adaptive Management

A 100-year plan necessitates Adaptive Management—a process of continuous iteration rather than static adherence. This framework allows Austin Water to pivot strategy as new data on climate science, population migration, or project performance emerges.

Accountability and Validation Mechanisms The plan’s integrity is maintained through rigorous oversight and transparency:

* Climate Technical Advisory Group (CTAG): Acting as the technical validators, these experts provided the climate projections and technical data underpinning the 666 modeling scenarios.
* Water Forward Task Force: Ensures that implementation remains reflective of community values and equity goals.
* Transparency Tools: Regular milestones are tracked via the Equity and Affordability Roadmap, a public dashboard for real-time monitoring, and a mandatory Five-Year Plan Update cycle.

By integrating rigorous stochastic modeling with a flexible implementation framework, WF24 ensures that Austin can navigate any of the 666 modeled scenarios. This integration of hydroclimatology into municipal strategy provides the foundation for a water-secure future through 2120.

## Report 2

**Water Forward**, the City of Austin’s **century-long strategic initiative** designed to guarantee a stable and lasting water supply for its expanding population. This comprehensive framework coordinates multiple city departments and technical experts to address **climate change risks** through diverse methods, including **aquifer storage**, **onsite water recycling**, and the construction of new reservoirs. Beyond infrastructure, the plan emphasizes **social equity** by tailoring programs to avoid placing unfair financial burdens on marginalized residents while maintaining **ecological health**. Detailed **financial projections** and implementation timelines are established to track progress, ensuring that the city meets specific yield targets for both **potable and non-potable water**. Public engagement serves as a cornerstone of the project, utilizing **community ambassadors** and educational outreach to foster a local culture of conservation. Ultimately, these reports serve as a roadmap for integrating **environmental stewardship** with the urban demands of a rapidly growing metropolitan area.

Based on the Water Forward 2024 plan and its appendices, Austin Water addresses climate change by treating it as a fundamental driver of future water scarcity rather than a static variable. The plan integrates advanced climate science to model a wide range of potential futures and creates a flexible "adaptive management" framework to respond as conditions evolve.

Here is a detailed breakdown of how the plan addresses climate change:

### 1. Integration of Advanced Climate Science
Austin Water collaborated with researchers at the University of Texas at Austin and a Climate Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) to incorporate the latest climate science into their planning.
*   **Global Climate Models (GCMs):** The planning process utilized data from five distinct Global Climate Models (GCMs) downscaled to the local Colorado River Basin.
*   **Emission Scenarios:** Planners did not rely on a single forecast. Instead, they analyzed three different future greenhouse gas emission scenarios (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways or SSPs), ranging from sustainable emissions (SSP1-2.6) to high fossil fuel development (SSP5-8.5).
*   **Projected Impacts:** The analysis projects increasing average temperatures, higher evaporation rates, and more variable precipitation. These factors are expected to result in lower streamflows into the Highland Lakes and more frequent, severe, and longer-duration droughts than Austin has historically experienced.

### 2. Planning for Uncertainty
Recognizing that the precise severity of climate change is unknown, Water Forward 2024 moves away from predicting a single outcome. Instead, it tests water management strategies against hundreds of plausible future scenarios.
*   **Scenario Modeling:** The plan modeled combinations of different climate futures (low, medium, and high warming), population growth rates, and regional supply developments.
*   **Droughts Worse than Record:** The modeling specifically included "stochastic" drought sequences—synthetic drought events generated to be worse than the historic 2010s "drought of record" to ensure the city is prepared for unprecedented dry spells.

### 3. Resilient Water Strategies
The plan proposes a diversified portfolio of strategies designed to be resilient across these various climate scenarios. Key strategies include:
*   **Conservation:** Reducing overall water demand through utility-side leak reduction and customer-side management (e.g., smart meters and water budgets) to mitigate the stress of hotter, drier conditions.
*   **Water Reuse:** Expanding the "GoPurple" reclaimed water system and onsite reuse requirements. This reduces the amount of water drawn from the river, preserving potable supplies for essential needs.
*   **Storage and Supply:** Implementing Aquifer Storage and Recovery (ASR) and using Decker Lake as an off-channel reservoir. These strategies allow Austin to store water during wet periods to "stretch" supplies during climate-induced droughts.

### 4. Adaptive Management Plan
Perhaps the most critical mechanism for addressing climate change is the plan's 100-year **adaptive management framework**.
*   **Regular Updates:** The plan is not static; it will be updated every five years to incorporate new climate data and actual observed conditions.
*   **Decision Trees:** The plan maps out "decision trees" for the next century (through 2120). If monitoring reveals that the climate is trending toward a "high severity" outcome (e.g., significantly higher temperatures and lower inflows), the utility can pivot to more aggressive strategies, such as brackish groundwater desalination, which might not be necessary under a "low severity" climate scenario.

### 5. Alignment with Climate Goals
The plan aligns with the City’s broader **Austin Climate Equity Plan**. It includes conservation strategies that reduce the energy required to treat and pump water, thereby supporting the city's goal of achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.

## Report 3

The Climate and Hydrology Analysis within Water Forward 2024 is a comprehensive technical effort designed to move the utility away from planning based solely on the past. Instead of assuming the future will look like the last century, this analysis integrates global climate science to stress-test Austin's water supply against a wide range of potential future conditions.

Here is a broad overview of the analysis, followed by the specific steps taken to translate global climate data into local water management tools.

### Broad Overview: Planning for Uncertainty
The primary goal of this analysis was to provide Austin Water with projections of temperature, precipitation, and streamflow under various future warming pathways. Rather than predicting a single outcome, the plan embraces uncertainty by using a "scenario-based" approach. This allows the utility to evaluate how different water management strategies perform across many plausible futures, ranging from sustainable emissions to high fossil-fuel development.

The work was a collaboration between Austin Water, researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, and a Climate Technical Advisory Group (CTAG) composed of experts in the field.

### Granular Details: The Technical Process
The analysis was broken down into sequential tasks that translated global data into local, actionable streamflow models:

**1. Selecting the Right Models (GCMs)**
Scientists started with 35 Global Circulation Models (GCMs) from the latest international climate project (CMIP6). They didn't just pick them at random; they evaluated how well each model reproduced historical weather patterns specifically for the Colorado River Basin. They selected the **five best-performing models** to ensure the foundation of the data was locally relevant.

**2. Defining Future Scenarios (SSPs)**
The analysis used three future greenhouse gas emission scenarios, known as Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), to bracket the uncertainty of the future:
*   **SSP1-2.6:** A sustainable path with lower warming.
*   **SSP2-4.5:** An intermediate path.
*   **SSP5-8.5:** A high-warming path driven by fossil-fuel development.

**3. From Global to Local (Downscaling)**
Because GCMs simulate the whole planet, their data is too "coarse" for local planning. Researchers "downscaled" this data to a finer resolution (specifically to local quadrangles over the Colorado River Basin) to generate daily projections of precipitation and temperature through the year 2100.

**4. Converting Weather to Streamflow (Hydrologic Modeling)**
Knowing the future temperature is useful, but water planners need to know how much water will be in the river.
*   **Neural Networks:** The team used a "multivariate flow model" built on neural network architecture. They trained this model using historical data to understand the complex, non-linear relationship between weather (rainfall, heat, evaporation) and the actual flow of the river.
*   **Climate-Adjusted Hydrology:** They fed the future climate projections into this model to generate "naturalized flow" datasets. This resulted in 126 different sets of hydrologic inputs that reflect how river flows might change under different emission scenarios at different times (e.g., 2040 vs. 2080).

**5. Stress Testing (Stochastic Droughts)**
The team recognized that the future might include droughts worse than anything we have seen in history.
*   **Synthesizing Droughts:** They used a technique called "Markov chain simulation" to reshuffle historical and projected years. This created 10,000-year sequences of synthetic hydrology.
*   **Worse than Record:** From these long sequences, they identified and selected drought events that were statistically similar to the historic "drought of record" (2010s) but persisted longer or had deeper cumulative deficits. This ensures the plan is robust against unprecedented dry spells.

### Key Takeaways from the Analysis
The results paint a clear picture of the risks facing the Colorado River Basin:
*   **Hotter and Flashier:** The models project increasing average temperatures and more frequent hot days (>100°F). Precipitation is expected to become more variable, meaning more intense rain events but also more frequent dry days.
*   **Declining Streamflow:** Despite some intense rain events, the overall trend shows decreasing river flows and reservoir inflows due to higher evaporation rates and drier soils.
*   **Seasonal Shifts:** The analysis suggests we will see fewer cold days (<32°F) and a shift in rainfall distribution, leading to more severe droughts interspersed with potential flood events.

## Report 4

Describe how the streamflow projections -- derived from GCM projections of precipitation and temperature -- were used to drive the Water Forward 2024 Water Availability Model (WF24 WAM) for evaluating WF24 needs and strategy portfolios against futures that included the impacts of climate change.

This is a complex technical process that connects global climate science to local water planning. To answer your query, I will break down how the Water Forward 2024 plan bridges the gap between raw climate data and the Water Availability Model (WAM) used to stress-test Austin’s water supply.

The process essentially functions as a translation chain: it converts Global Climate Model (GCM) weather data into local river flow data, adjusts historical records to reflect those future flows, and then feeds those adjusted records into the WAM to evaluate water strategies.

Here is the step-by-step description of that process:

### 1. The Foundation: Neural Network Flow Modeling
Before the WAM could be updated, planners needed to know how changes in temperature and precipitation would physically alter the amount of water flowing into the Highland Lakes.
*   **The Problem:** GCMs provide weather data (rainfall and heat), not river flow data.
*   **The Solution:** Consultants developed a "multivariate flow model" using a **neural network architecture**. This Artificial Intelligence model was first "trained" using historical data (1983–2016) to understand the complex, non-linear mathematical relationship between daily weather patterns and the observed "naturalized flow" of the river,.
*   **The Projection:** Once the neural network learned how the river responds to weather, the team fed it the *future* precipitation and temperature projections from the five selected GCMs under three different emission scenarios (SSPs). This generated new datasets of projected river flows through the year 2100.

### 2. Updating the WAM: Quantile Mapping
The WAM is built to run on a specific sequence of monthly historical data (1940–2022). To incorporate climate change, the team did not simply replace this history; they *adjusted* it to reflect the intensity of future climate conditions while preserving the historical pattern of wet and dry months.
*   **Quantile Mapping:** The team used a statistical technique called "quantile mapping." This involves taking the statistical distribution of the *future* flows generated by the neural network and mapping them onto the *historical* WAM record.
*   **The Result:** This created 126 new sets of hydrologic input files. For example, a "2070 high-warming" scenario in the WAM still follows the sequence of the 1950s drought, but the specific flow volumes in those months are adjusted downward to reflect the hotter, drier conditions projected for the year 2070.

### 3. Stress Testing: Stochastic Droughts
Planners recognized that the future might not just be *hotter* than the past; the actual *sequence* of dry years might be worse. To address this, the plan utilized **stochastic modeling** to create droughts worse than the historic "drought of record" (2010s).
*   **Markov Chain Simulation:** The team used a technique called Markov chain simulation to reshuffle the years of the historical and climate-adjusted records. This created a synthetic 1-million-year timeline that retained the statistical probability of transitioning from a wet year to a dry year (or dry to dry).
*   **Finding the Worst Cases:** From this massive dataset, they identified specific drought sequences that were longer or deeper than anything Austin has historically faced. They selected 10 specific "stochastic" drought events for each climate scenario to test within the WAM.

### 4. Driving the WAM and Evaluating Portfolios
Finally, these climate-adjusted and stochastic hydrologic datasets were loaded into the WF24 WAM to evaluate the city's needs and strategies.
*   **Identifying Needs:** The WAM simulated how the reservoir system would behave under these future conditions. It identified "unmet needs"—periods where the combination of high demand and climate-reduced supply caused shortages.
*   **Testing Strategies:** Austin Water then tested portfolios of strategies (like aquifer storage, reuse, and conservation) against these hundreds of scenarios. A strategy portfolio was considered successful if it could meet water demands across a wide range of these plausible climate futures, rather than just working for a single prediction.

In summary, the GCM data drove the WAM by first teaching a neural network how the river behaves, using that knowledge to adjust the severity of historical flows, and then reshuffling those flows to create unprecedented drought scenarios for stress testing.
